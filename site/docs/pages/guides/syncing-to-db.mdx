# Replicate Snapchain data to Postgres

### Pre-requisites
- Read access to a Snapchain node

While some applications can be written by directly querying Hubble, most serious applications need to access the data
in a more structured way.

[Shuttle](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/hub-monorepo/tree/main/packages/shuttle) is a package
that can be used to mirror Hubble's data to a Postgres DB for convenient access to the underlying data.

Check out the [documentation](https://github.com/farcasterxyz/hub-monorepo/blob/main/packages/shuttle/README.md) for more information.
