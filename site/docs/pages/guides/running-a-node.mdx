# Run Snapchain on AWS

:::tip
If your goal is to get started as quickly as possible, consider a managed service like [Neynar](https://neynar.com/) instead of running your own node.

This guide will get you set up with a Snapchain node on an AWS EC2 instance and will cost roughly $100/month. You can run Snapchain on any server you like and costs may vary depending on provider.


## Launch a new instance
1. In AWS, go to EC2 > Instances > Launch Instances
2. Give it a name and select Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type and 64-bit (x86). Choose m5.xlarge instance type .

6. Click Launch Instance on the right-hand side menu.

## Configure network firewall

1. Go to EC2 → Instances and find your instance

2. Go to EC2 → Instances, click on the Instance ID and copy the IPv4 Address
3. Connect with `ssh ubuntu@<ipv4 address> -i key.pem`

## Start syncing a node

``` bash 
# Install docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
chmod +x get-docker.sh
./get-docker.sh

# Start Snapchain
mkdir snapchain && cd snapchain
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/farcasterxyz/snapchain/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.mainnet.yml -o docker-compose.yml
sudo docker compose up # -d to run in background, if you set up rootless docker remove sudo
```

Follow the remaining steps in [Getting Started](/getting-started) to validate and query your node.
