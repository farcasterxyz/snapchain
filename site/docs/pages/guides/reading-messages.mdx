# Reading casts from Snapchain 

#### Pre-requisites
- Read only access to a node

See [running a node](/guides/running-a-node) for more information on how to set up a node.

## Querying for a user's FID
```
curl https://fnames.farcaster.xyz/transfers?name=<username>
```
Look at the `to` field for the FID associated with the username.

## Querying for the user's casts

To query all the casts for a particular FID, you can use the [castsByFid](/reference/httpapi/casts#castsbyfid) HTTP endpoint:

```bash
# Default http port is 3381
$ curl http://localhost:3381/v1/castsByFid\?fid\=1 \
| jq ".messages[].data.castAddBody.text \
| select( . != null)"
"testing"
"test"
"another test"
"another testy test"
```

This returns all the cast related messages for the FID. There are similar endpoints for reactions and follows. 

If you have Snapchain installed from source, you can use the [GetAllCastMessagesByFid](/reference/grpcapi/casts#api) GRPC API.

```bash
grpcurl -plaintext -proto src/proto/rpc.proto -import-path src/proto  -d '{"fid" : 1}' localhost:3383 HubService/GetAllCastMessagesByFid \
| jq ".messages[].data.castAddBody.text \
| select( . != null)"
```
