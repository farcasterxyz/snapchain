# Getting started

## Run a node 

``` bash
mkdir snapchain
cd snapchain
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/farcasterxyz/snapchain/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.mainnet.yml -O docker-compose.yml
sudo docker compose up # -d to run in background, if you set up rootless docker remove sudo
```

To learn more about Snapchain's architecture, read the [whitepaper](/whitepaper). To start building an app on Snapchain, take a look at the [guides](/guides/running-a-node).
