# Getting Started

:::tip
If your goal is to get started as quickly as possible, consider a managed service like [Neynar](https://neynar.com/) instead of running your own node.
:::

## Requirements

- 16 GB of RAM
- 4 CPU cores or vCPUs
- 2 TB of free storage
- A public IP address with ports 3381 - 3383 exposed

## Sync a node

The easiest way to run Snapchain is using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/). Once installed, run the following commands in a new folder


``` bash
# Fetch the docker compose file from the repository
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/farcasterxyz/snapchain/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.mainnet.yml -o docker-compose.yml

# Start the container
docker compose up # -d to run in background, may need to run with sudo depending on your docker setup
```

Check the the docker logs to ensure that the snapshot is being downloaded. 

```bash
sudo docker logs -f snapchain-snap_read-1

....
```

Snapshots are about 200 GB in size and may take a few hours to sync and decompress. Once complete, you should see logs like this: 

```
2025-04-16T08:20:01.749980Z  INFO node{name=Block}:sync{height.tip=[0] 1875918 height.sync=[0] 1875919}: informalsystems_malachitebft_sync::handle: Requesting sync value from peer height.sync=[0] 1875920 peer=12D3KooWCc28TYrrXFivwUshyZ8R5HqPMgx4f7AP54iCDLYr7kFR

```

It will take a few hours for the node to sync. You can monitor it by running:

``` bash
curl localhost:3381/v1/info | jq

# if the nodes are in sync, the blockdelay values for shards should be in the single digits.

{
  "dbStats": {
    "numMessages": 656823920,
    "numFidRegistrations": 1049519,
    "approxSize": 324437755099
  },
  "numShards": 2,
  "shardInfos": [
    {
      "shardId": 0,
      "maxHeight": 1932723,
      "numMessages": 0,
      "numFidRegistrations": 0,
      "approxSize": 1114006028,
      "blockDelay": 5,
      "mempoolSize": 0
    },
    {
      "shardId": 2,
      "maxHeight": 1945363,
      "numMessages": 326936052,
      "numFidRegistrations": 523905,
      "approxSize": 161319650355,
      "blockDelay": 6,
      "mempoolSize": 4294967295
    },
    {
      "shardId": 1,
      "maxHeight": 1966901,
      "numMessages": 329887868,
      "numFidRegistrations": 525614,
      "approxSize": 163118104744,
      "blockDelay": 5,
      "mempoolSize": 4294967295
    }
  ]
}

```

## Query a node

Once the node is in sync you can start querying it for the latest messages from a user. You'll need the user's account id to get their messages. If you don't have this handy, you can do a lookup by username from the public Farcaster name server. 

```bash
# Query for the id associated with the @farcaster account
curl https://fnames.farcaster.xyz/transfers?name=farcaster

{
  "transfers": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "timestamp": 1628882891,
      "username": "farcaster",
      "owner": "0x877...06ed",
      "from": 0,
      "to": 1,
      "user_signature": "0xa6fdd...471b",
      "server_signature": "0xb718...c41b"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `@farcaster` user's account id is 1, and so you can fetch the latest messages by querying the node over its [HTTP API](/reference/httpapi/httpapi):

```
curl http://localhost:3381/v1/castsByFid\?fid\=1 \
 | jq ".messages[].data.castAddBody.text \
 | select( . != null)"
```
