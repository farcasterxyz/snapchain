# Getting started

## Run a node 

First, ensure [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) is installed. Then run the following

``` bash
mkdir snapchain
cd snapchain
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/farcasterxyz/snapchain/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.mainnet.yml -O docker-compose.yml
docker compose up # -d to run in background, may need to run with sudo depending on your docker setup
```

It will take a few hours for the node to sync. You can monitor it by running:

``` bash
curl localhost:3381/v1/info | jq
```

The node has caught up when `blockDelay` is close to 0 for all shards. It represents the number of seconds the node is behind the latest block.

To learn more about Snapchain's architecture, read the [whitepaper](/whitepaper). To start building an app on Snapchain, take a look at the [guides](/guides/running-a-node).
